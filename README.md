#DESCRIPTION

This project involves using Python to fetch data from a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) and creating meaningful visualizations using Matplotlib or Seaborn. The goal is to extract insights from real-time or historical data and present them in an interactive dashboard.

Features:
Fetch real-time or historical data from a public API (OpenWeatherMap, CoinGecko, COVID-19 API, etc.).
Process and clean the retrieved data for analysis.
Create visualizations such as line charts, bar graphs, and heatmaps to display trends.
Develop a simple dashboard using Streamlit or Dash to interactively explore the data.
Deliverables:
A Python script for fetching and processing API data.
A visualization dashboard showcasing insights from the data.
This project demonstrates how to integrate real-world data with data visualization to make insights more accessible. 🚀
